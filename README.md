## 🎨 UI Preview

### Dashboard Features
- **Statistics Cards**: View total tasks, to-do, in-progress, and completed counts
- **Search & Filter Bar**: Quickly find tasks with advanced filtering
- **Task Cards**: Beautiful, color-coded cards with priority indicators
- **Status Badges**: Visual status indicators for each task

- 🔵 **Medium**: Blue highlights
- 🟢 **Low**: Green accents

## 🔒 Security Features

### SQL Injection Protection
The application uses Django ORM's parameterized queries, making SQL injection attacks impossible:
```python
# Safe - Django ORM
Task.objects.filter(title__icontains=user_input)

# Malicious input: "' OR '1'='1"
# Treated as literal string, not SQL code
```

### Foreign Key Constraints
- **CASCADE**: Deleting a project removes all its tasks
- **PROTECT**: Cannot delete categories in use
- **SET_NULL**: Deleting assigned users doesn't delete tasks

### Authentication
- All task views require login
- Users can only modify their own tasks
- Password hashing with Django's built-in auth

## 📊 Database Models

### Task
Main model with foreign keys to:
- `created_by`: User (CASCADE)
- `assigned_to`: User (SET_NULL)
- `category`: Category (PROTECT)
- `project`: Project (CASCADE)

### Category
- Protected deletion (PROTECT constraint)
- Cannot delete if tasks reference it

### Project
- Cascade deletion removes all tasks
- Perfect for cleaning up completed projects

### Comment
- Linked to tasks (CASCADE)
- Tracks user and timestamp

- **Database**: SQLite (development)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5
