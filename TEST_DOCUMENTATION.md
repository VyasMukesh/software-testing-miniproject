## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Foreign Key Violation Tests (5 Tests)

#### Test 1: CASCADE Delete on Project
**Objective**: Verify that deleting a project cascades and deletes all related tasks

**Model Relationship**:
```python
Task.project -> Project (on_delete=CASCADE)
```

**Test Scenario**:
1. Create a project with 2 tasks
2. Delete the project
3. Verify all related tasks are automatically deleted

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Before deletion: 2 tasks exist
- After deletion: 0 tasks remain
- CASCADE constraint works correctly

---

#### Test 2: PROTECT Constraint on Category
**Objective**: Verify that categories with related tasks cannot be deleted

**Model Relationship**:
```python
Task.category -> Category (on_delete=PROTECT)
```

**Test Scenario**:
1. Create a category
2. Create a task using that category
3. Attempt to delete the category

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- ProtectedError is raised
- Category remains in database
- Data integrity maintained

**Business Logic**: Prevents accidental deletion of categories that are in use

---

#### Test 3: SET_NULL on User Delete
**Objective**: Verify that deleting an assigned user sets task.assigned_to to NULL

**Model Relationship**:
```python
Task.assigned_to -> User (on_delete=SET_NULL, null=True)
```

**Test Scenario**:
1. Create a task assigned to a user
2. Delete that user
3. Verify task.assigned_to becomes NULL

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Task remains in database
- assigned_to field set to NULL
- Task data preserved

---

#### Test 4: CASCADE Delete on Task Creator
**Objective**: Verify that deleting a user deletes all tasks they created

**Model Relationship**:
```python
Task.created_by -> User (on_delete=CASCADE)
```

**Test Scenario**:
1. User creates 2 tasks
2. Delete the user
3. Verify all their tasks are deleted

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- All tasks created by user are deleted
- Maintains referential integrity

---

#### Test 5: CASCADE Delete on Comments
**Objective**: Verify that deleting a task deletes all related comments

**Model Relationship**:
```python
Comment.task -> Task (on_delete=CASCADE)
```

**Test Scenario**:
1. Create a task with 2 comments
2. Delete the task
3. Verify all comments are deleted

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Comments automatically deleted with task
- No orphaned records

---

### 2. SQL Injection Protection Tests (3 Tests)

#### Test 6: SQL Injection in Search
**Objective**: Verify Django ORM protects against SQL injection in search queries

**Attack Vectors Tested**:
```sql
' OR '1'='1                              -- Classic bypass
'; DROP TABLE tasks_task; --             -- Table destruction
' UNION SELECT * FROM auth_user; --      -- Data exfiltration
<script>alert('XSS')</script>            -- XSS attack
```

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- All malicious inputs safely escaped
- Database remains intact
- No unauthorized data access
- Application returns normally (200 status)

**Protection Mechanism**: Django ORM uses parameterized queries

---

#### Test 7: SQL Injection in Filters
**Objective**: Test injection attempts in filter parameters

**Attack Vector**:
```python
status_filter = "todo' OR '1'='1"
```

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Django treats entire string as literal value
- No SQL execution occurs
- Returns 0 results (no matching status)

---

#### Test 8: Parameterized Query Verification
**Objective**: Confirm Django uses prepared statements

**Test**:
```python
malicious_title = "Test' OR '1'='1"
Task.objects.filter(title=malicious_title)  # Returns 0
```

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- ORM generates parameterized queries
- SQL injection is impossible by design
- Values are passed as parameters, not concatenated

**SQL Generated** (example):
```sql
SELECT * FROM tasks_task WHERE title = %s
-- Parameter: "Test' OR '1'='1"
```

---

### 3. Data Migration Tests (3 Tests)

#### Test 9: Data Integrity After Schema Change
**Objective**: Verify existing data remains intact when schema evolves

**Simulation**:
1. Create tasks with original schema
2. Add new fields with default values
3. Verify old data accessible

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- All existing tasks accessible
- New fields have proper defaults (e.g., priority='medium')
- No data loss

---

#### Test 10: Data Mismatch Detection
**Objective**: Test database constraints and validation

**Tests**:
1. **Missing Required Field**: Create task without created_by
   - Result: ✅ IntegrityError raised
   
2. **Unique Constraint**: Create duplicate category names
   - Result: ✅ IntegrityError raised
   
3. **Invalid Choice**: Set invalid status value
   - Result: ⚠️ Allowed at model level (form validation required)

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Database constraints enforced
- Data integrity maintained

---

#### Test 11: Migration Rollback Scenario
**Objective**: Verify transaction rollback on migration failure

**Test Scenario**:
```python
with transaction.atomic():
    create_task_1()
    create_task_2()
    raise Exception("Migration error")  # Simulated failure
```

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- All changes rolled back
- Database state unchanged
- Atomicity maintained

---

### 4. Regression Tests (7 Tests)

#### Test 12: Task Creation
**Objective**: Ensure task creation still works after patches

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Form submission successful
- Task saved to database
- Proper redirect

---

#### Test 13: Task Update
**Objective**: Verify task editing functionality

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Task fields updated correctly
- Changes persisted to database

---

#### Test 14: Task Deletion
**Objective**: Ensure deletion works properly

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Task removed from database
- Proper redirect after deletion

---

#### Test 15: Search Functionality
**Objective**: Verify search still works

**Test**: Search for "Python" in tasks

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Returns 1 matching task
- Non-matching tasks excluded

---

#### Test 16: Filter Functionality
**Objective**: Test status filtering

**Test**: Filter tasks by status='todo'

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Returns only tasks with status='todo'
- Count matches expected

---

**Objective**: Verify login required for protected views

**Expected Result**: ✅ PASS
- Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- Protected views inaccessible without auth

---
